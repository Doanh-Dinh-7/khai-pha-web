Apple Intelligence: Its biggest features and when you can expect them
 
Apple’s iPhone 16 is out, but the company hasn’t made its iOS 18 Apple Intelligence features available to all consumers just yet. In July, Apple rolled out these features to users on the iOS 18 developer beta and added the AI features for public beta users earlier this week. However, if you are not using these experimental versions of the software, then you’ll have to wait a bit to get Apple Intelligence features.
Below is a timeline of when these features are expected to arrive. 
Writing tools
This AI-powered feature will proofread your text, summarize it, or even change the tone to professional, concise, and friendly. Keep in mind that the tool stumbles while handling swear words and controversial topics like drugs and murder.

Availability timeline: October (with iOS 18.1)
Compatible devices: iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 16 series

New Siri
Apple has given Siri an AI makeover with a new animation around the border of the screen. Siri can better understand your requests, including pauses and changes of requests, such as setting a timer for 15 minutes instead of 10 minutes, all in one go. You can also chat with Siri through text by tapping on the bottom of the screen.






Siri can also be a how-to assistant, as it now has knowledge of Apple products. For example, you can ask Siri how to change certain settings.

Compatible devices: iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 16 series

Image cleanup in Photos
Similar to Google’s Magic Eraser, the iPhone will gain a feature that helps you remove unwanted objects and people from an image. It can automatically detect unwanted objects, but you can manually draw over them or circle them to select these objects or people. Once you press the cleanup button after selecting, Apple Intelligence tries to fill in the gap without ruining the overall aesthetic of the picture.

New Photos app features
The new Photos app will be able to create new Memories through prompts, thanks to Apple Intelligence. Apple claims that Apple Intelligence has more knowledge about the contents of an image, so you can also use natural language to search for different photos.

Notification summaries
Apple will summarize multiple notifications coming from apps like Mail, Messages, and even third-party apps like WhatsApp.
